ART Online Banking App with Digital Committee Services:
   The ART Online Banking App is a secure, user-friendly digital banking platform that allows users to manage their finances with ease. It provides essential banking features such as withdrawing funds, checking account balance, depositing money, changing MPIN, viewing mini-statements, and tracking transaction history. The platform also includes administrative access for monitoring overall transaction data. With the new Digital Committee feature, the app goes beyond traditional banking to offer a culturally relevant savings solution. Users can create or join savings committees, define monthly contributions, set payout methods (Fixed, Random, or Lowest-Bid), and track contributions automatically. A built-in risk and default management system flags members who miss or delay payments, while the automated payout engine distributes funds according to the committee rules. Members earn a Digital Trust Score for timely contributions, which can support future micro-loans or credit assessment. By integrating traditional banking with modern fintech and the digital committee feature, the app empowers users with financial transparency, security, and community-based savings, bridging the gap between conventional savings practices and digital finance.
